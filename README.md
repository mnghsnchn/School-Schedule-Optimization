# School-Schedule-Optimization

# Goal: determine the most feasible and  rigorous opportunity for improvement is to maximize the usage of Marshall classrooms  while applying different penalties to limit the number of morning class, Friday class, 8  am section class and lunch time class. 

# An optimal class schedule should fulfil studentsâ€™  demand as many as possible and consider plausibility at same time. In addition,  considering many part time students only can take evening section class, we decided to  have at least one evening section for each core course. 

# For the purpose of this project,  the scope was limit to 2-unit and 4-unit undergraduate courses and exclude lab  and discussion sections.
